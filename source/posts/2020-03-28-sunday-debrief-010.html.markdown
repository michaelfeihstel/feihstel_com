As tradition of this series dictates this episode, again, takes its time to calmly drip, doze and drift through an extensive ambient section before slowly moving on to more colorful pastures: Psychedelic folk and roadtrippy pop, followed by a brief latin section that paves the way to more uplifting and lighthearted territories, which evolve and escalate into classic disco, soul and funk throughout the rest of the remaining odd 2 hours before finding an ending in one of my last year's favorites: Justine's "Wordless Songs EP". Probably out of place in this setting, but a great closer regardless.
