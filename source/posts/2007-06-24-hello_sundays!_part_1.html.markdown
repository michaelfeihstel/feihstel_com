This is the first mix in a series, that is meant to be an eclectic selection of songs for those lazy Sundays you like to spent on your favorite couch. Freshness wasn't a requirement for the tracks featured here, which is why you'll want new releases alongside older classics, some of them in an unusual setting and others layered on top of each other - with interesting results.
